A simple, robust Python calculator designed to be understandable for a 5th-grade student while including unique features and professional error handling.

## Features

- **Basic Math**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Advanced Math**: Remainder (Modulo) and Power (Exponents).
- **Study Buddy Mode**: Instantly generates Multiplication Tables (1-10).
- **Memory**: Keeps a history of all calculations performed during the session.
- **Crash Protection**: Uses `try-except` blocks to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.

## How to Run

### Requirement
- Python 3.x installed.

### Steps
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing `calculator.py`.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `calculator.py`: The main program file (under 100 lines).
- `instructions.txt`: Detailed steps for running on a Linux Terminal.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.


## 📝 Learning Concepts
This project demonstrates:
- **Control Flow**: Loops (`while`) and Conditional Logic (`if/elif/else`).
- **Error Handling**: Using `try/except` to prevent program crashes.
- **Lists**: Storing and displaying a history of items.
